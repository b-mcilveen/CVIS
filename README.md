## Overview

The project is split into two sections, the CVIS interpreter and the react frontend.
The main frontend can be found in src/pages and src/app.tsx

The interpreter is located in src/CVIS/*

Components in src/components/ui are imported from Shadcn/ui, a component library that is used to build the frontend.
